# Demo Talk Track (3–5 minutes)

## 0) Open (10–15s)
“Agentic Analytics Studio connects live analytics (Tableau) to action (Slack) — it audits pipeline risk, explains why, and executes recommended actions with one click.”

## 1) Show the UI loads (10s)
- Open the app URL
- Point out “Insight Dashboard” + “Actions” panels

## 2) Run the audit (30–45s)
- Click **Run**
- Narrate: “It scans opportunities, scores risk, and generates actions.”
- Call out the top risk item (e.g., OPP4) + score + driver (no activity in N days)

## 3) Show live Tableau context (20–30s)
- Point to the embedded Tableau view in “Insight Dashboard”
- “The agent attaches the relevant dashboard context for the recommendation.”

## 4) Execute an action (20–30s)
- Click **Approve** on the Slack alert action
- “That executes in real mode — posting to Slack instantly.”

## 5) Prove it in Slack (10–15s)
- Switch to Slack channel (e.g., `#aas-test`)
- Show the message that just arrived

## 6) Close (10s)
“Same pattern scales to more actions (tasks, tickets, CRM updates). The key is: live analytics → explainable recommendation → one-click execution.”
