# Agentic Analytics Studio package

"""
The `aas` package contains the core code for the Agentic Analytics Studio.

Modules are organised into subpackages:

* `agents` – definitions of agent workflows for each hero play.
* `services` – clients for external systems (Tableau, Salesforce, Slack, etc.).
* `models` – simple data classes for play results and actions.
* `utils` – helper functions such as logging.
* `data` – sample datasets for development and testing.

The top‑level package exposes nothing by default. Use the submodules directly.
